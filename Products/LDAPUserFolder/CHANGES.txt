To see changes for older releases please see HISTORY.txt.

2.20 (2011-05-04)
-----------------

- Fix for CVE-2010-2944
  (http://secunia.com/advisories/cve_reference/CVE-2010-2944/),
  which was never reported upstream by the Debian people, who
  found the problem 8 months ago (see
  http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=593466).
  Thanks guys.


2.19 (2011-01-10)
-----------------

- Add attribute name to the negative_cache_key so requests 
  for same value but different attribute do not poison the 
  cache.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/695821)

- The changed base classes in Zope 2.13 did not define 
  isPrincipiaFolderish, so the user folder would no longer show
  up in the left hand navigation pane in the ZMI.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/693315)

- Fixed a faulty check for unicode so user expiration will not
  fail if a unicode value is passed in. Changed all checks for
  string and unicode to use basestring.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/700071)

- Fixed an export/import test error so all tests run again.

- The Manager DN Password value on the ``Configure`` tab in the 
  ZMI showed up in clear text when viewing the HTML source for 
  the rendered page.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/664976)


2.18 (2010-07-29)
-----------------

- Added a new flag ``purge`` to the ``ldap-servers`` and 
  ``ldap-schema`` export/import XML elements for finer-grained 
  control over value purging for those two settings if the 
  global purge flag is not set.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/586970)

- The export/import code did not handle server definitions 
  using the ``ldapi`` protocol correctly.
  (part of https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/586970)

- When adding a new server definition, the comparison to avoid 
  duplicate server definitions was faulty. Furthermore, operations 
  and connection timeout values were disregarded for duplicate 
  server definitions.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/586967)


2.17 (2010-05-28)
-----------------

- Added GenericSetup magic to fully provide the INode interface
  for the exporter and importer classes, making it easier to nest
  within other importers.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/586531)


2.16 (2010-04-15)
-----------------

- depend on dataflake.ldapconnection so tests run without 
  any hassle.

- Use sha hexdigests instead of digests to build cache keys,
  digest values can contain non-ASCII characters.


2.15 (2010-04-12)
-----------------

- Changed import/export test code to be compatible with 
  GenericSetup 1.5

- No longer force-inject the "fakeldap" module into the module
  namespace sys.modules as "ldap" for testing


2.14 (2009-12-22)
-----------------

- Updated compatibility with CMF 2.1 and the upcoming 
  dataflake.ldapconnection 1.0

- Potential Bug: Avoid cache hash clashes by recomputing the hash 
  when the admin clears the caches in the ZMI
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00629)

- Bug: _lookupuserbyattr created its own user search filter and 
  did not take the _extra_user_filter attribute into account
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00640)


2.13 (2009-05-02)
-----------------

- Factoring: Removed the SSHA module in favor of using Zope's 
  AccessControl.AuthEncoding module to handle password creation for 
  most types of encryption.

- Bug: Binary attribute handling in manage_addUser was broken. Only the
  first character in the binary attribute's value would be stored.

- Miscellaneous: Weed out all LDAP search calls that would indiscriminately
  pull all attributes from a user record. This will reduce server load if
  the user record contains large attributes such as jpegPhoto.

- Feature: Added GenericSetup support with import/export steps for the
  LDAPUserFolder. When installing the LDAPUserFolder via Buildout, make
  sure to specify the extra name "exportimport" to automatically pull
  the GenericSetup dependency: Products.LDAPUserFolder[exportimport]

- Factoring: GenericSetup profile registration and CMF skin folder 
  registration now moved from code to ZCML. Renamed profile
  "default" to "cmfldap", that's a more descriptive name. The minimum CMF
  version required for installing the CMF integration is now 2.1.0, which
  implies Zope 2.10.4 or later.


2.12 (2008-10-21)
-----------------

- Bug/LDAPDelegate: Use the canonical explode_dn method when splitting
  up a DN for escaping its values instead of hand-splitting on ",", which
  breaks if the DN contains commas in any value. Patch by Russell Sim.
  This also required cleaning up one test that used an invalid DN format.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00623)

- Factoring: For testing, use the fakeldap module from the 
  dataflake.ldapconnection package instead of maintaining a copy here.

- Factoring: Refactored unit tests to use ZopeTestCase and ZopeLite instead 
  of hand-rolling ZODB connections etc.

- Bug: Added explicit CMFDefault dependency for the CMF-related functions
  by adding an extras_require in setup.py.

- Bug: Make sure a user is purged from the negative cache when the user
  is explicitly expired.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00617)


2.11 (2008-08-01)
-----------------

- Feature: The site administrator may now set an arbitrary LDAP search
  filter expression that will be applied to all user searches in 
  addition to the default filters. Only those user records matching both
  the default filter and this arbitrary filter expression will be
  returned. CAUTION: The filter expression must conform to standard LDAP
  filter syntax. Setting a wrong value will lock out your users!
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00615)

- Factoring: Move the LDAP server configuration off the Configure
  tab in the ZMI to its own LDAP Servers tab to avoid overcrowding the
  configuration view even more.

- Bug: The unit tests for the LDAPMemberDataTool and the 
  LDAPMembershipTool did not run due to a faulty import.

- Bug: The ZMI Caches tab erroneously suggested that a cached user's 
  last access time would be recorded and/or updated. This was not the case, 
  it is recorded at user object creation and then never updated. The Caches
  tab will now reflect the creation time. Since the API to set or query the
  last access time was not used anywhere it has been removed.
  (in response to http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00614 by Stefan
  Loidl)


2.10 (2008-07-21)
-----------------

- Bug: Recreating the internal cache hash key inside 
  LDAPUserFolder.__setstate__ can lead to values differring from one thread 
  to the next, leading to unnecessary extra LDAP lookups for values already 
  cached under the original key.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00608 by Stefan Loidl)

- Factoring: LDAPUserFolder.__setstate__: Removed old backwards-compatibility 
  gyrations.

- Bug: FakeLDAP could not handle BASE-scoped searches

- Bug: LDAPUserFolder.searchUsers mishandled searches on DN by not passing
  the correct BASE search scope through. Found by Nico Grubert.


2.9 (2008-06-04)
----------------

- Bug: LDAPUserFolder.getUserByAttr: The negative login cache used for 
  preventing repeated LDAP requests when a user enters wrong
  creadentials was keyed on user login alone. This would prevent 
  subsequent logins with the correct password. Thanks to Tarek 
  Ziade for test and patch and Gilles Lenfant for filing the issue.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00605)

- Refactoring: test suite: Rearrange imports to prevent error messages when 
  the CMF is not present.

- Bug: LDAPDelegate.search: Improve searches on binary attributes such as
  objectGUID by introducing a method argument that prevents 
  UTF*-conversion of the filter expression passed in.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00576 by Wichert Akkerman)

- Feature: Improve binary attribute handlng by introducing a binary flag 
  for LDAP schema items that is consulted when inserting/modifying an
  attribute flagged that way. Introduce a hardcoded list of 
  binary attributes to no convert from UTF-8 when searching.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00598 Dragos Chirila)

- Bug: LDAPUserFolder.getUserByAttr: made login attribute and uid attribute
  retrieval safer by explicitly providing a default.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00602 by Martin Gfeller)

- Bug: ZMI Groups tab: Asking for the type of group via a separate
  LDAP search for every group listed is unfeasible for installations
  with large numbers of groups, it is now only done if the total
  number of groups is less than 50.


2.9-beta (2008-01-01)
---------------------

NOTE: In order to use the LDAP-based CMF membership components
      you need CMF version 2.1.0 or higher.

- Bug: Added a __setstate__ hook for deleting old-style logger
  instances which were removed for version 2.7 but are now showing
  up as "broken" objects and may prevent Plone migration scripts
  from working correctly, pointed out by Martijn Pieters.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00574)

- Bug: Removed failing unit test for old-style Zope 2 interfaces that
  no longer exist in the CMF

- Bug: CMFLDAP skins: Cleanups and changes to align the custom skin
  scripts and templates with their CMF 2.1.0 counterparts

- Bug: LDAPMemberDataTool: The "Member Properties" ZMI tab was broken
  due to a typo in the ZPT code.

- Bug: LDAPMemberDataTool: Adjusted wrapUser to match the changed 
  behavior in CMF 2.1.0 and up.

- Bug: LDAPMembershipTool/LDAPMemberDataTool: Since the core CMF tools 
  no longer support the IActionProvider interface the tests to
  prove the LDAP-based versions support these interfaces have been
  removed.

- Bug: The functional test rig setup has been changed to avoid 
  DeprecationWarning-Messages from GenericSetup 1.3 and up.

- Bug: LDAPUserFolder.searchGroups: Make the code more defensive for 
  situations where a search would return groups without members,
  suggested by Nick Davis.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00584)

- Feature: Added negative caching for users to avoid querying the LDAP 
  server again and again for invalid logins. Patch provided by Wichert
  Akkerman.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00572)

- Feature: added a group/membership mapping for group type "univentionGroup"
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00569)

- Documentation: Noted the danger of trying to install the CMFLDAP 
  extensions into a Plone site: Just don't do it, you will suffer!
