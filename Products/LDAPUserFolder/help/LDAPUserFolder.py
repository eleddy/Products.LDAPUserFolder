        Return all user objects. Since the number of user records in 
        an LDAP database is potentially very large this method will
        only return those user objects that are in the internal cache
        of the LDAPUserFolder and not expired.

        Return a list of user IDs for all users that can be found 
        given the selected user search base and search scope.

        This method will return a simple error message if the 
        number of users exceeds the limit of search hits that is 
        built into the python-ldap module.

        Return the user object with the UserID "id". The User ID

        This method is not called from any DTML or python product
        code, but it is the heart of any user folder. Do not use 
        it in your code, this explanation is just for understandings
        sake.

        This method is called by the Zope security machinery. Its
        arguments are the current REQUEST dictionary, the username
        and password pair returned by a basic auth login box
        (concatenated with a colon into the auth_info argument), and 
        the roles that are given to any user by specifying "Default
        Roles" in the LDAPAdapter setup.

        If successful, a new LDAPUser object is created and returned. 
        If not, None is returned, which will cause the Zope security
        machinery to throw an exception indicating that the user is 
        not authenticated to access the resource.

    def getGroups(attr):

        Return a list of available group records under the group record
        base as defined in the LDAPUserFolder. The attr argument determines
        what gets returned and it can have the following values:

        o None: A list of tuples is returned where the group CN is the first
          and the group full DN is the second element.

        o cn: A list of CN strings is returned.

        o dn: A list of full DN strings is returned.

        Add a new group under the group record base. If REQUEST is not None a
        MessageDialog screen will be returned. The group_name argument forms
        the new group CN while the full DN will be formed by combining this
        new CN with the group base DN.

        Since a group record cannot be empty, meaning there must be at least 
        a single uniqueMember element in it, the DN given as the binduid in 
        the LDAPUserFolder configuration is inserted.

        Find user records given the *search_param* string (which is the name 
        of an LDAP attribute) and the *search_term* value.

        This method will return a list of dictionaries where each matching
        record is represented by a dictionary. The dictionary will contain 
        a key/value pair for each LDAP attribute, including *dn*, that is
        present for the given user record.

    def searchUsers(attrs=[], exact_match=False, **kw):

        Search for user records by one or more attributes.

        This method takes any passed-in search parameters and values as
        keyword arguments and will sort out invalid keys automatically. It
        accepts all three forms an attribute can be known as, its real
        ldap name, the name an attribute is mapped to explicitly, and the 
        friendly name it is known by.

        Retrieves all details for a user record represented by the DN that
        is handed in as the URL-encoded *encoded_dn* argument. The format
        argument determines the format of the returned data and can have
        two values:

        o None: All user attributes are handed back as a list of tuples
          where the first element of each tuple contains the LDAP attribute
          name and the second element contains the value.

        o dictionary: The user record is handed back as a simple dictionary
          of attributes as key/value pairs.

        The desired attributes can be limited by passing in a sequence of
        attribute names as the attrs argument.

        Determine whether a given LDAP attribute (attr) and its value (value)
        are unique in the LDAP tree branch set as the user record base in the 
        LDAPUserFolder. This method should be called before inserting a new 
        user record with attr being the attribute chosen as the login name in
        your LDAPUserFolder because that attribute value must be unique.

        This method will return a truth value (1) if the given attribute value
        is indeed unique, 0 if it is not and in the case of an exception it
        will return the string describing the exception.

        Create a new user record. If REQUEST is not None, it will be used to
        retrieve the values for the user record.

        To use this method from Python you must pass None as the REQUEST
        argument and a dictionary called *kwargs* containing key/value pairs
        for the user record attributes.

        The dictionary of values passed in, be it REQUEST or kwargs, must at
        the very least contain the following keys and values:

        o *cn* or *uid* (depending on what you set the RDN attribute to)

        o *user_pw* (the new user record's password)

        o *confirm_pw* (This must match password)
